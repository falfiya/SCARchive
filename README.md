# SoundCloud, meet my good friend yt-dlp

How many tool files do I need to accomplish something so simple??

- `.editorconfig` to enforce style
- `.gitignore` so that I don't commit stuff I shouldn't
- `.python-version` because `uv` makes it
- `Makefile` as a task-runner
- `package-lock.json` I guess this one is kind of important
- `package.json` yeah ok
- `pyproject.toml` all I wanted was `yt-dlp`
- `uv.lock` is this the `package-lock.json` equivalent for `uv`?

In all seriousness, I am grateful to have `uv`. [**I know what the alternative is.**](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)
